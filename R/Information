Here is the R code that allowed us to perform the classification.

In the document "Code_project", you will find the main section on the reference text, including the part on tokens, 
evaluation of class presence, optimal method for our dataset, and clustering.
In the documents "Project_2" and "Project_3", you will find the main section with the other key ("Project_2") and the 
other text ("Project_3"). 
In the documents "2lettre" and "4lettre", you will find the section on tokens of different sizes, including size 2 ("2lettre") 
and size 4 tokens ("4lettre").
